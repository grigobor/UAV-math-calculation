# UAV VTOL (tailsitter) calculation
This project describes the calculation of a vertical take-off and landing unmanned aerial vehicle based on given characteristics.

## Work structure
The project consists of the following sections:
- Initial data. Without it, nothing can be calculated. Some of it may seem excessive, but all of it is important for subsequent calculations.
- Calculation block. This section provides formulas from various sources to optimally calculate the aircraft's characteristics. This section will be described in more detail later.
- Aerodynamic calculations and UAV construction block. The final aircraft model with aerodynamic characteristics will be obtained.
